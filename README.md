# 🧮 Credit Risk Modeling: Give Me Some Credit Dataset

This repository contains a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to **predict the risk of serious credit delinquency within the next two years**, based on the [Give Me Some Credit dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit) from Kaggle.

We perform **EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, class balancing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, SHAP explainability**, and build a deployable **Streamlit application** for real-time prediction.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Univariate, bivariate, and correlation heatmaps
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Imputation, scaling, SMOTE for class imbalance
- 🤖 **Modeling**: Random Forest classifier with GridSearchCV tuning
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, classification report, ROC AUC score
- 🔍 **Explainability**: Model interpretability via SHAP values
- 🖥 **Deployment**: Interactive Streamlit app with prediction and SHAP visualization
